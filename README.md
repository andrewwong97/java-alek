#### Personal Course Recommendation Assistant

Initially wanted to write an Android app calculating possible course paths, but eventually decided that releasing a web app was ideal. Ended up switching to Python Django. All in all, I had a lot of fun using a lightweight browser called Jaunt to web scrape course data that was not available on the ISIS Classes API.
